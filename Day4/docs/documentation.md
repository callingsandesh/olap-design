FROM main_table as agg_main_table
GROUP BY agg_main_table.employee_id,agg_main_table.shift_date

  ```
  It will create aggregate of difference columns like hours_worked,has_taken_break,break_hour,was_charge,charge_hour,was_on_call,on_call_hour FROM the `main_table`

  ```
  CREATE VIEW agg_shift AS
select employee_id,shift_date,array_agg(shift_type) AS shift_type

group by employee_id,shift_date
  ```
 
 It will create the array of aggregates of shift types from the column by grouping by the employee_id and shift_date
